Space Frogger

Elizabeth Stansberry and Aidan Fingeret

Project Description:
A frog stranded in space needs to make his way back to his froggy home planet. The frog avoids asteroids coming from right to left while trying to shoot enemy spaceships. Once all the enemy spaceships he must make his way across the level to get to the wormhole. After the first level the enemy spaceships will start shooting back at the frog. Player will use WASD or arrow movement and use the spacebar to shoot. If the player succeeds in all levels, the frog is reunited with his friends and family on his planet. The player will have three lives for the entire game; if the player dies, by asteroid or enemy fire, the level will restart and the player will lose a life.

Elizabeth's Deadlog: <br/>
5/24/21 - I created all of the classes and individual files, basically just the skeleton of the program, and then I added a few new methods that we discussed in class. <br/>
5/26/21 - I wrote the code for the frog's basic appearance and wrote a loop to add stars to the background. <br/>
5/28/21 - I fixed an issue with the background <br/>
5/31/21 - I made a fix with the instantiation of our ArrayLists, and added the code for the Alien spaceship. <br/>


Aidan's Deadlog: <br/>
5/24/21 - I created the constructors for each of the classes and then wrote some barebones code for the move methods in each class. <br/>
5/26/21 - I updated all the double variables to float and starting working on the SpaceFrogger code: I instantiated some ArrayLists for the different classes, wrote the keyPressed method, and starting working on the setup and draw methods.  <br/>
5/28/21 - Made entity an abstract class, fixed keyPressed, cleaned up Frog constructor and display variable names, and changed move methods to use dx and dy. <br/>
